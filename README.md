# week-4-game

I left this very basic code on my repo because it was something I built 4 weeks into my coding education. The layout, functionality, and design is very basic, but I'm proud that I was able to do it at the time!

It also serves as a reminder how far I progressed over the 20 weeks that followed during class.
